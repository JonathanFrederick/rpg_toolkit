## RPG tools

This is a project for developing tools to aid both players and dungeon/game masters of table-top Role-Playing Games.  It is initially intended to be run and used locally, though as development progresses it could turn into something to be hosted by a DM for their group to be able to access privately.

### Goals
- Flexibility regarding system
  - The app should be able to be configured for different editions
  - I believe there are enough similarities between editions for this to be possible
  - However, I will initially be building this with Pathfinder in mind
- Character generators
  - Player characters, NPCs, monsters, monsters with character levels
- Data used
  - Eventually this will be able to parsing materials that are legal to use
    - Race and class characteristics, spells, bestiary entries, etc.
  - Manual entry option available for DMs with non-OGL resources and/or creativity
- Encounter/Battle tracker
  - A DM will easily reference characters in an encounter
    - in order of initiative
    - as they interact with each other
- Tagging system
  - Various aspects of the game will have tags pertaining to relevant situations
  - Environment, creature type, status, etc.
  - DMs should receive notification when a character has a relevant ability/characteristic
